# Novel-Based-Sentiment-Analysis

Implemented a sentiment analysis model to identify polarity of customer reviews with an accuracy rate of 60%. I used open review datasets as a learning set and aimed to identify hidden semantic and sentiment aspects to predict overall ratings or sentiment of reviews. I built this model by applying the Latent Dirichlet Algorithm (LDA) and transformed reviews into object-opinion pairs. The model then used the generated aspect term and the corresponding opinions words for sentiment aspect to detect the sentiment.  
Environment: Java, NLP library, Product Review data set
